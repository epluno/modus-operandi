# Communication

## Expectations

- **Collaborative:** We work collaboratively, and are excited to work openly and closely with you and your team. Everyone on the team should understand the problems that we’re solving. No knowledge should be siloed.

- **Respectful & Transparent:** Everyone on the team should talk transparently to each other. Hiding concerns or anxiety only makes hard conversations harder. Let’s address issues, together, as they come up. Respect regular working hours.

- **Clear & Direct:** The clearer we communicate, the faster that we’ll be able to move on your project. Be direct in feedback. Speak through the lens of problems and your customers.

- **Friendly:** We enjoy helping you solve problems for your customers. Our personality and energy will show through in our communication, we hope to see yours as well.

## Acceptable Forms of Communication

### Discord

[Discord](http://discord.com) is used for communication and collaboration among Epluno team members.  Discord allows for direct messaging, chat channels, group conference voice or video calls, and screen sharing. Chat channels can be created for specific group members or projects. Discord will keep the complete history of messages and chat channels so information is not lost.

To mention a person in a group message specifically, type `@username` in the message, replacing username with the persons username.

### Click Up

Comments can be made on specific projects, assignments, or tickets within Click Up. Support tickets can also be created in Click Up.

### **Email**

Epluno email accounts are used primarily for external communication. Generally should not be used for communication among team members.

### Office Phones
