> eplunoâ„¢ is a 100% *severless* operation

The entire infrastructure is configured using [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) using a series of droplets, networking, load balancing, spaces, and managed databases. Generally speaking, epluno, will try and keep all resources inside any of the NYC data centers. This allows for private networking using `IPv6` for each service to talk to each other and offers low latency as well as gigabit transfer rates without bandwidth quota limitations.
