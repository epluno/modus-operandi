## Research Frames the Problem or Opportunity Weâ€™re Solving For

Since we're building products for people, it makes sense to start with people. A great product is a response to a painful problem, and we use research to make sure we know everything about that problem. Research is our first step in mitigating the risk that comes with building a product.

We talk to or observe people to find out what pain points and problems they are having. We learn about their own solutions and how they came to be. Then, we look at what outcome they are hoping for and what goal they are trying to achieve. This outcome helps fuel our understanding of the problem and allows us to start with a baseline understanding of the language and culture around that problem. It saves us time by making sure that we are solving painful problems that are worth the investment that we put into solving them.
