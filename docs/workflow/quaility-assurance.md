# Quality Assurance

```

Quality Assurance (QA) ensures that end-users get a functional user interface and the best user experience when using a web app or website. It examines a website or web application to try and uncover any flaws that might have been overlooked during design and development. 

Test-Driven Development moves code failure earlier in the development process. It's better to have a failing test on your development machine than in production. It also allows you to have tighter feedback cycles.

Quality Assurance usually involves:

1. Requirement testing

1. Design evaluation

1. Functionality testing

## Requirement Testing

Requirement testing takes into account the requirements that were expressed by the client as well as other client-approved design documents. The QA tester compiles a list of expectations and requirements and uses them to evaluate the layout, prototype and/or alpha version of a website or web app. Requirement testing is essential throughout the development process to ensure that the project team meets all of their mission objectives.

## Design Testing

Design testing looks at the appearance of the web app or website. When testing the design, the QA tester checks whether the look and feel of the web app or website are in line with the proposed design and overall layout. The process of design testing is multi-faceted and includes such activities as browser testing and mobile testing.

## Functionality Testing

Functionality testing evaluates both the UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) of a web app or website. It usually is the final step in Quality Assurance testing. It is a rigorous process that ensures that each link, button, form and all the other features are operating as they should. The website or app is tested across various browsers and platforms to ascertain that the end user will have no problems browsing or using the site or app.

## Code Review

Code review is also an essential part of QA. See [Code Review](https://app.clickup.com/2232791/v/dc/244eq-2107/244eq-630) for more information on code reviews.
