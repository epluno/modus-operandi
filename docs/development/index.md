## Onboarding

When onboarding new team members, we want to get them up to speed as soon as possible. This documentation can be used to help them get familiar with how we work here at Epluno.

In addition here is a check list of things to do for onboarding a new team member:

- Collect developers information

- Invite them to remote repositories 

  - Github

  - Gitlab

- Shared team goals

- Give them assignments

## Project Management

We use [Click Up](https://clickup.com/) to keep track of to-do tasks, goals, deadlines, notes, support tickets, etc. It helps teams work together, stay productive, organized, and accountable.

For more information on how to use Click Up click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/workflow/click-up/).


## Coding Style Guide

Within the the project repositories, we keep an editor.config file that specifies the style and formatting to be used.

Code should be well commented and documented! Other and future team members need to be able to understand the code you write so that they can use and update it when you are not around. 


## Tools

Everyone is free to use their own developing environments and machines.

We mainly use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for our editor. VS Code will automatically style the code according to the editor.config file in the project repositories.


## Freelance Friday

Technology is constantly changing, being updated, and improving. Therefore it is important that we are staying current with these changes and learning about new things. 

On Fridays, you are free to spend some time learning and working on non work related projects.


## Basic Development Process

1. Create a local feature branch based off master.
2. When feature is complete and tests pass, stage the changes.
3. When you've staged the changes, commit them.
4. Write a good commit message.
5. Share your branch.
6. Submit a GitHub pull request.
7. Ask for a code review in Discord.
8. A team member other than the author reviews the pull request. 
9. They make comments and ask questions directly on lines of code in the GitHub web interface or in Discord.
10. When satisfied, they approve or comment on the pull request that it's ready to merge.
11. Rebase interactively. Squash commits like "Fix whitespace" into one or a small number of valuable commit(s). Edit commit messages to reveal intent.
12. View a list of new commits. View changed files. Merge branch into master.
13. Delete your remote feature branch.
14. Delete your local feature branch.
