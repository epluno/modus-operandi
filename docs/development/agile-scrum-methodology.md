# Agile Scrum

**Scrum** is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products, with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields including research, sales, marketing and advanced technologies. It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within time boxed iterations, called *sprints*, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks. The Scrum Team track progress in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings, called daily scrums. At the end of the sprint, the team holds sprint review, to demonstrate the work done, and sprint retrospective to continuously improve.

## Stand Up

Daily 15 minute conference call at 10 AM with dev team members to discuss previous days progress, any blocks that we had, and what we are working on today.

## Sprints

A design sprint orients the team and aims our efforts toward a mutual goal. It allows us to invest our time and money wisely by eliminating inherent risk in building products by shortening the product design feedback loop with real world data as a focused group.

Epluno's sprints each last 6 weeks long.

At the end of the sprint, the team should have a shared understanding of the problem and have tested assumptions with a prototype. After testing, the team should decide on and document next steps for the product. 

That could mean: 

- Rolling into product design and development 

- Taking learning from the testing and starting a new Design Sprint

- Deciding not to move forward with the product
